# Data Analytics with SQL
Welcome to my Data Analytics with SQL repository! This collection showcases how I use SQL to manage, analyze, and draw insights from complex datasets.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a foundational tool in data analytics. It enables efficient querying, data manipulation, and insight extraction from large-scale databases. In this repository, you’ll find a variety of projects and resources that demonstrate my skills in SQL-based data analysis.

The projects included here span several key areas:

Database Creation & Management

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Advanced SQL Querying

Analytical Thinking & Problem Solving

Each project highlights my ability to extract actionable insights from raw data and present them clearly and effectively. I’ve also included SQL-based reporting examples designed to support decision-making by turning data into compelling narratives.

To support your own learning journey, I’ve added helpful resources focused on strengthening SQL skills and analytical thinking.

Thank you for exploring my repository. I hope you find the work insightful and inspiring. Feel free to connect if you'd like to discuss any project or collaborate further. Happy analyzing!
